This directory outlines results used to produce the tables and plots
in the following CIKM 11 Poster Paper:

  S. Sanner, S. Guo, T. Graepel, S. Kharazmi, S. Karimi
  (2011). Diverse Retrieval via Greedy Optimization of Expected 1-call@k
  in a Latent Subtopic Relevance Model. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM
  Conference on Information and Knowledge Management 
  (CIKM-11). Glasgow, UK.

File to test domain mapping:

- TREC 6-8: trec68_15*
- ClueWeb 2009: clueweb1_15*
- ClueWeb 2010: clueweb2_15*

The 15 refers to the fact that LDA was trained with 15 latent topics
(the optimal value among 5, 10, 15, and 20).

File types:

(1) [domain].txt: mean subtopic recall vs. rank
(2) [domain].avg.txt: results from (1) averaged over queries
(3) [domain]_ndeval.txt: results from ndeval script
(4) [domain]_ndeval.avg.txt: results from (3) averaged over queries

Column meanings in files:

Column 1: query ID 

Column 2: algorithm ID, here

  1 - MMR (lamdba=.5) BM25/TFIDF
  2 - MMR (lamdba=.5) using LSI/LDA kernel for similarity / diversity
  3 - Exp-1-call@k: as defined in the paper cited above

Column 3: evaluation type, here

  1 - Uniform subtopic recall (uniform weighting of topics)

  2 - Weighted subtopic recall (weighting of topics according to
      proportion in qrels)

  3 - Output measures from ndeval script for ClueWeb diversity track

Columns 4+: specific to column 3, here

  Column 3=1,2: subtopic recall @ k for k=1..20

  Column 3=3:   nedval measures as follows, in order
     ERR-IA@5,ERR-IA@10,ERR-IA@20,nERR-IA@5,nERR-IA@10,
     nERR-IA@20,alpha-DCG@5,alpha-DCG@10,alpha-DCG@20,
     alpha-nDCG@5,alpha-nDCG@10,alpha-nDCG@20,NRBP,nNRBP,
     MAP-IA,P-IA@5,P-IA@10,P-IA@20,strec@5,strec@10,strec@20
     (note: the very last column -- strec@20 -- may be missing in 
      some of the ndeval data)
