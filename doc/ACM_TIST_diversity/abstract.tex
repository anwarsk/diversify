It has been previously noted that optimization of the $n$-call@$k$
relevance objective (i.e., a set-based objective that is 1 if at least
$n$ documents in a set of $k$ are relevant, otherwise 0) encourages
more result set diversification for smaller $n$, but this statement
has never been formally quantified.  In this work, we explicitly
derive the mathematical relationship between \emph{expected
$n$-call@$k$} and the \emph{relevance vs. diversity trade-off} ---
through fortuitous cancellations in the resulting combinatorial
optimization, we show the trade-off is a simple and intuitive
function of $n$ (notably independent of the result set size $k \geq n$), 
where diversification increases as $n \to 1$. Empirical results on three diversity testbeds including the TREC 6-8 Interactive
Track, 2009 and 2010 ClueWeb Diversity tasks of the TREC Web Track support our theoretical derivations.
