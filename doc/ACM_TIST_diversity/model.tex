We review the \emph{probabilistic subtopic model of binary relevance}
from~\cite{sanner11} shown as a directed graphical model 
in Figure~\ref{fig:gm}.
Shaded nodes represent observed variables, unshaded nodes are
latent.  Observed variables are the query terms
$\vec{q}$ and selected items $s_i$ (where for $1 \leq i \leq k$, $s_i
\in D$).  For the subtopic variables, let $T$ be a discrete subtopic
set.  Then $t_i \in T$ represent subtopics for respective
$s_i$ and $t \in T$ represents a subtopic for query $\vec{q}$.  The
$r_i$ are $\{ 0,1\}$ variables that indicate if respective selected
items $s_i$ are relevant ($r_i=1$).

The conditional probability tables (CPTs) are as follows: $P(t_i|s_i)$
and $P(t|\vec{q})$ respectively represent the subtopic distribution
for item $s_i$ and query $\vec{q}$.  %The remaining CPTs are 
For the $r_i$ CPTs, using $\I[\cdot]$ as a $\{0,1\}$ indicator 
function (1 if $\cdot$ is true), 
item $s_i$ is deemed \emph{relevant}
\emph{iff} \emph{its subtopic $t_i$ matches query subtopic $t$}:

\begin{align*}
P(r_{i}=1|t, t_{i}) & \; = \; \I[t_{i} = t]
\end{align*}
Here, $\I[\cdot]$ is $1$ when its argument is true and $0$ otherwise.
We next define $R_k = \sum_{i=1}^k r_i$, where $R_k$ is 
the number of relevant items from the first $k$ selections.  
Reading $R_k \geq n$ as $\I[R_k \geq n]$, 
we express the \emph{expected $n$-call@$k$} objective as 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:setRelevance}
  \ExpNCall{n}(S_k,\vec{q})
  = \mathbb{E}[R_k\geq n|s_1,\dots,s_k,\vec{q}] .  
\end{align}
Since jointly optimizing $\ExpNCall{n}(S_k,\vec{q})$ is NP-hard, we
take a greedy approach similar to MMR where we choose the best $s_k^*$
assuming that $S_{k-1}^*$ is given, and present the main derivaiton results in the following section.
