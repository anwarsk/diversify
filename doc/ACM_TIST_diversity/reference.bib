	within the Bayesian paradigm. At the lowest level of the hierarchy,
	a Gibbs distribution is used to specify a probability distribution
	on all the possible partitions of the utterance. The number of partitioning
	elements which are phonemes is not specified a priori. At a higher
	level in the hierarchical specification, random variables representing
	phoneme durations and acoustic vector values are associated reported
	about 0.9 percent word error rate. The new model was experimentally
	compared to continuous density mixture HMM (CDHMM) on a same recognition
	task, and gave significantly smaller word error rates.},

	phenomenon formalized in prospect theory, can explain a variety of
	field and experimental data. Quantifications of loss aversion are,
	however, hindered by the absence of a general preference-based method
	to elicit the utility for gains and losses simultaneously. This paper
	proposes such a method and uses it to measure loss aversion in an
	experimental study without making any parametric assumptions. Thus,
	it is the first to obtain a parameter-free elicitation of prospect
	theory's utility function on the whole domain. Our method also provides
	an efficient way to elicit utility midpoints, which are important
	in axiomatizations of utility. Several definitions of loss aversion
	have been put forward in the literature. According to most definitions
	we find strong evidence of loss aversion, at both the aggregate and
	the individual level. The degree of loss aversion varies with the
	definition used, which underlines the need for a commonly accepted
	definition of loss aversion.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel method to extract robust features for
	text-independent speaker identification from short utterances. This
	method is perceptually motivated and inspired by the perceptual linear

	log area ratio (PLAR). It is perceptual in the sense that it depends
	on notions from psychoacoustics where the robustness can be assured.
	Also, the log area ratio is an effective feature for recognizing
	speakers as it embodies the geometry and dynamics of the vocal tract,
	which are very much person-dependent. This research thus focuses
	on providing a reliable vocal biometric from speakers, which can
	be used effectively with full-band and telephone-band speech in noisy
	environments. Intensive performance analysis has been performed to
	benchmark the proposed method against the commonly-used features
	using different databases in different noisy environments. In almost
	all usable cases the PLAR proved its superiority over the commonly-used
	features such as MFCC and LPCC.},

	To improve the performance of traditional automatic speaker recognition
	system, the authors proposed a novel approach utilizing the inegration
	of visual stream with audio stream. The Facial Animation Parameters
	(FAPs), supported by the MPEG-4 standard, were used as the visual
	features; the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), signal
	energy with their first and second order time derivatives were employed
	as the audio features. The feature vectors for visual and audio were
	of 9 and 39 dimensions, respectively. The observation vectors was
	formed by appending the visual observation feature vectors to the
	audio observation feature vectors, which were modelled by Hidden
	Markov Models (HMMs). The HMMs for each speaker is left-right topology
	with 10 states. Based on the proposed method, the authors presented
	two frameworks of speaker identification and verification, and both
	of them were tested using the Carnegie Melon University (CMU) audio-visual
	database. A Gaussian noise source ranging from 0dB to 20dB was used
	to test performance under noisy conditions. Under clean condition,
	20dB, 10dB, and 0dB, the person identification error (percent) was
	5.13, 7.69, 10.26 and 12.82, respectively. For the person verification
	results, the person verification results judged by false accept rate,
	false reject rate and equal error rate were better than that using
	audio only. The result indicated that the proposed system can considerately
	improve the performance of speaker recognition based only on audio.\\
	Since the database employed for evaluating the proposed method contains
	only 10 subjects, the results cannot be considered reliable. To further
	support the conclusion, larger database should be used. }

	The ACW scheme modifies the linear predictive (LP) spectral components
	(resonances) so as to emphasize the formant structure by attenuating
	the broad-bandwidth spectral components. Such components are found
	to introduce undesired variability in the LP spectra of speech signals
	due to environmental factors. The ACW cepstral coefficients represent
	an adaptively weighted version of the LP cepstrum. The adaptation
	results in deemphasizing the irrelevant variations of the LP cepstral
	coefficients on a frame-by-frame basis. Experiments are presented
	using the San Diego portion of the King database. The ACW cepstrum
	is shown to offer improved speaker identification performance as
	compared to other common methods of cepstral weighting.},

	used to structuring the sports video. Two SVMs were used since SVM
	is a two-class classifier. Due to the attributes of sports video,
	three audio classes in sports videl were defined, namely, Play-audio,
	Advertisement-audio, and Studio-audio. After the classification using
	SVMs, smoothing rules was used in final segmentation of an audio
	sequence based on the fact that it is highly impossible to change
	the audio types too suddenly. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness
	of the proposed framework. If the class of previous clip and next
	one is the same, then the class label of the current one will be
	set to that of the previous one. Experimental results showed that
	the segmentation accuracy was improving after the application of

	of yound and old. Previous study involved the method of neural networks.
	Here, the authors attempted to perform gait classification using
	supprot vector machines (SVMs), an emerging machine learning tool.
	For the application of SVMs, the performance was largely influenced
	by the kernel. As a consequence, this paper employed three types
	of kernel functions including linear, polynomial and radial basis
	function (RBF) kernels. For training of SVMs, the authors presented
	two methods. First, the SVMs was first trained using feature extracted
	from individual minimum foot clearance (MFC)-plot and Poincar\'{e}
	images using the data of 30 young and 28 elderly participant from
	the gait database of the Biomechanics Unit of Victoria University.
	Cross-validation test resulted in the an average generalization performance
	of 83.3 percent, which proved to be superior than the neural network
	since its accuracy is 75.0 percent. Furthermore, a ``hill-climbing"
	feature algorithm was used to selecet a small feature set (3-5) of
	gait features. Based on the training using this subset, the SVMs
	led to an improved performance of 90 percent accuracy. Also, three
	types of kernel were compared, and RBF proved to perform best in
	recognizing MFC gait-paterns. Finally, the author reported that the
	only part of the features were effective for gait classification.
	Meanwhile, they indicated that the best feature was interquartile
	range/Median since it was the only feature including the information
	of variability and central tendency. This feature should be further
	investigate in order to figure out whether it was appropriate to
	recognize person based on his/her gait.},

  annote = {The authors attempted to provide a survey of the state-of-the-art
	text-independent speaker verification. A framework of the training
	and test for speaker verification was first presented. Cepstral analysis,
	the most widely used parametrization method of audio signals, was
	formulated. Specifically, the authors introduced the filterbank-based
	and LPC-based cepstral parameters. Then, the paper presented speaker
	modeling techniques such as neural networks (NN), Support Vector
	Machines (SVM), and Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM). Each method
	has its advantages and disadvantages. For neural network, its advantage
	involve 1) discriminant-traning power, 2) a flexible architecture
	that faciliate to use the contextual information, and 3) weaker assumption
	about the statistical distributions of the observations. However,
	neural network suffers from some shortcomings. However, neural network
	also suffer from some shortcomings: 1) the optimal structure need
	to be selected by trail-and-error procedures, 2) the available train
	data have to be split to training and cross-validation sets, and
	3) it can not easily handle the temporal structure of speech signals.
	Regarding SVMs, they are well suited to separate complex regions
	between two classes by an nonlinear decision boundary. The crucial
	point to use SVM for speaker recognition is to design the appropriate
	kernel function. One disadvantage of SVM is that it can not handle
	the temploral structure of the speech signals. As for GMM, it can
	be used to model the speaker when there is no prior knowledge of
	what the speaker will say. Score normalization and evaluation of
	speaker verification system were then discussed. Score normalization
	is to deal with score variability causing by nature of the enrollment
	materials, mismatch between traning and testing sets. For evalution
	of speaker verification system, two types of errors are introduced:
	false rejection and false acceptance. Furthermore, the authors listed
	the extension of the speaker verification such as speaker tracking
	and segmentation. Then, the authors reviewed applications of speaker
	recognition in on-site applications, remote applications and the
	structuring of audio information and games. Moreover, the application
	of speaker recognition in forensic area was reviewed. Finally, the
	paper presented the research trends in the future as follows: \begin{itemize}
	\item Currently, the widely used features are low-level spectrum.
	Actually, higher level of information can be exploited and used in
	speaker recognition \item Researchers should focus on real-world
	robustness by improving compensation techniques. Meanwhile, speech
	under various handsets, channel, and acoustic environments should
	be obtained, which will faciliate the evaluation of the systems.
	\item Another trend is to perform speaker recognition in unconstrained
	situations. \end{itemize} },

	(PCA) for data mod- elling is that of choosing the appropriate num-

	the formulation of a Bayesian treatment of PCA (Bishop, 1999a) in
	terms of a probabilistic latent variable model. A central feature
	of this approach is that the effec- tive dimensionality of the latent
	space (equiv- alent to the number of retained principal com- ponents)
	is determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure.
	In com- mon with most non-trivial Bayesian models, however, the required
	marginalizations are an- alytically intractable, and so an approximation
	scheme based on a local Gaussian representa- tion of the posterior
	distribution was employed. In this paper we develop an alternative,
	varia- tional formulation of Bayesian PCA, based on a factorial representation
	of the posterior distri- bution. This approach is computationally
	effi- cient, and unlike other approximation schemes, it maximizes
	a rigorous lower bound on the marginal log probability of the observed
	data.},

  abstract = {In many situations, a set of hard constraints encodes the feasible
	configurations of some system or product over which multiple users
	have distinct preferences. However, making suitable decisions requires
	that the preferences of a specific user for different configurations
	be articulated or elicited, something generally acknowledged to be
	onerous. We address two problems associated with preference elicitation:
	computing a best feasible solution when the user's utilities are
	imprecisely specified; and developing useful elicitation procedures
	that reduce utility uncertainty, with minimal user interaction, to
	a point where (approximately) optimal decisions can be made. Our
	main contributions are threefold. First, we propose the use of minimax
	regret as a suitable decision criterion for decision making in the
	presence of such utility function uncertainty. Second, we devise
	several different procedures, all relying on mixed integer linear
	programs, that can be used to compute minimax regret and regret-optimizing
	solutions effectively. In particular, our methods exploit generalized
	additive structure in a user's utility function to ensure tractable
	computation. Third, we propose various elicitation methods that can
	be used to refine utility uncertainty in such a way as to quickly
	(i.e., with as few questions as possible) reduce minimax regret.
	Empirical study suggests that several of these methods are quite
	successful in minimizing the number of user queries, while remaining
	computationally practical so as to admit real-time user interaction.},

	involve the use of a belief state---a probability distribution over
	the state of the process at a given point in time. Unfortunately,
	the state spaces of complex processes are very large, making an explicit
	representation of a belief state intractable. Even in dynamic Bayesian
	networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented compactly,
	the representation of the be- lief state is intractable. We investigate
	the idea of maintaining a compact approximation to the true be- lief
	state, and analyze the conditions under which the errors due to the
	approximations taken over the lifetime of the process do not accumulate
	to make our answers completely irrelevant. We show that the error
	in a belief state contracts exponentially as the process evolves.
	Thus, even with multiple approx- imations, the error in our process
	remains bounded indefinitely. We show how the additional structure
	of a DBN can be used to design our approximation scheme, improving
	its performance significantly. We demonstrate the applicability of
	our ideas in the con- text of a monitoring task, showing that orders
	of mag- nitude faster inference can be achieved with only a small
	degradation in accuracy.},

	develop a model of user preferences by querying or otherwise interacting
	with a user. Recent approaches to elicitation using minimax regret
	have proven to be very powerful in simulation. In this work, we test
	both the effectiveness of regret-based elicitation, and user comprehension
	and acceptance of minimax regret in user studies. We report on a
	study involving 40 users interacting with the UTPref Recommendation
	System, which helps students navigate and find rental accommodation.
	UTPref maintains an explicit (but incomplete) generalized additive
	utility (GAI) model of user preferences, and uses minimax regret
	for recommendation. We assess the following general questions: How
	effective is regret-based elicitation in finding optimal or near-optimal
	products? Do users understand and accept the minimax regret criterion
	in practice? Do decision-theoretically valid queries for GAI models
	result in more accurate assessment than simpler, ad hoc queries?

	for GAI models. We also assess the relative difficulty of specific

	of support vector machines have been proposed that iteratively select
	a single new example from a set of un- labelled examples, query the

	criterion. We present a new approach that is especially designed
	to construct batches and incorporates a diver- sity measure. It has
	low computational re- quirements making it feasible for large scale
	problems with several thousands of examples. Experimental results

	To solve this problem, the authors presented a pincipled framework

	This framework provided a generative approach, which supported easy
	and robust integration of multi source information. The proposed

	Four tasks have been involved in the testing, namely, 3D single person

	tracking - audio only. The results demonstrated that the mutlimodal
	framework were superior to the unimodal system. The proposed method
	for information fusion should be further investigated since it proved
	to be a useful framework for information fusion.}

	ubiquitous computing, there is a great potential for individuals

	see and buy, but the privacy risks are severe. In this paper we describe
	a new method for collaborative filtering which protects the privacy
	of individual data. The method is based on a probabilistic factor
	analysis model. Privacy protection is provided by a peer-to-peer
	protocol which is described elsewhere, but outlined in this paper.
	The factor analysis approach handles missing data without requiring
	default values for them. We give several experiments that suggest
	that this is most accurate method for CF to date. The new algorithm
	has other advantages in speed and storage over previous algorithms.
	Finally, we suggest applications of the approach to other kinds of
	statistical analyses of survey or questionaire data.},

	signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning
	tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned
	for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper
	reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop
	nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals,
	and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel
	regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three
	domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there
	are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We
	present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based
	methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch
	an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask
	learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains,
	and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture
	there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

	shift in the music industry away from physical media formats and

	types of online information and there are now hundreds of music streaming

  abstract = {Contextual advertising supports much of the Web's ecosys- tem today.
	User experience and revenue (shared by the site publisher ad the
	ad network) depend on the relevance of the displayed ads to the page
	content. As with other document retrieval systems, relevance is provided
	by scoring the match between individual ads (documents) and the content
	of the page where the ads are shown (query). In this paper we show
	how this match can be improved significantly by aug- menting the
	ad-page scoring function with extra parameters from a logistic regression
	model on the words in the pages and ads. A key property of the proposed
	model is that it can be mapped to standard cosine similarity matching
	and is suitable for efficient and scalable implementation over in-
	verted indexes. The model parameter values are learnt from logs containing
	ad impressions and clicks, with shrinkage estimators being used to
	combat sparsity. To scale our com- putations to train on an extremely
	large training corpus con- sisting of several gigabytes of data,
	we parallelize our fitting algorithm in a Hadoop [10] framework.
	Experimental eval- uation is provided showing improved click prediction
	over a holdout set of impression and click events from a large scale
	real-world ad placement engine. Our best model achieves a 25% lift
	in precision relative to a traditional information retrieval model
	which is based on cosine similarity, for re- calling 10% of the clicks
	in our test data.},

	A unified view of this topic is presented, based on a decision-theoretic

	structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems
	and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design
	problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that,
	in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions
	change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility
	function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the
	experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical
	justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

	Based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), the authors proposed a mixed
	type audio classification system. The features used in this system
	can be categorized into two types, namely, audio features and four
	different representation formats for each feature. The audio features
	consisted of variance of zero crossing rate and silence ratio from
	time domain, harmonic ratio and sub-band energy from frequency domain.
	The extracted audio data were first segmented into 5 second audio
	clips and each clip was further divided by a 1 second window into
	5 segments, from which the four audio features were extracted. Finally,
	for each clips, four different representation format as final features
	were calculated in terms of mean, max, min and (max+min)/2. This
	system was capable of classifying audio data into five types: music,
	speech, environment sound, speech mixed with music, and music mixed
	with environment sound. The experiments were conducted on the audio
	clips extracted from movies. Experimental results demonstrated that
	the proposed system was superior to k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Neural
	Network (NN), and Naive Bayes (NB). Future work includes the division
	of environment sound into finer subclasses, such as nature environment
	sound, animal sound and man-made sound. Furthermore, a classification
	using both labelled and unlabelled data as training set for SVM is
	expected to be developed due to the expensive expenditure of manually
	labelling of audio data.}

	modifications to develop a simplified version of this model, which
	is linear except for the computation of the square-root value of
	the energy. Experiments of speech/music and speech/non-speech classification
	tasks were used to evaluate the proposed system. Experimental results
	demonstrated that both the original auditory spectrum and the proposed
	simplified auditory spectrum achieved more robust performance in
	noisy test cases than the conventional fast Fourier transformed-based
	spectrum. In addition, desipte of a reduced computational complexity,
	the performance of the proposed simplified auditory spectrum was

	(speech/nonspeech) classification under noisy environment, the average
	classification error rate was 5.6\% (4.0\%) and 7.3\% (4.9\%), which

	in the context of biometrics. Since mono-modal recognition techniques
	will reach a saturation in near future, an alternative way is to
	consist in combining results from several modalities. For each modality,
	a machine experts, referred to as experts, can deliver opinions,
	more precisely, scores, which indicates the authenticity level of
	a person's claim being a certain client. The problem is how to represent
	and conciliate these scores to reach a single opinion on the authenticity
	level of the user's identity claim. In this paper, the authors proposed
	an algorithm serving as a supervisor module in a multi-expert decision
	make machine. The supervisor module did not interfere with and did
	not have access to the computational of each expert leading to a
	modular system, the modalities of which can be added or removed depending
	on the application at hand. This resultsed in a general system where
	$m$ independent modules (experts) performed the estimation of the
	authenticity level of the claimed user on their own data and provided
	opinions as a number, namely, score. The variance of the scores can
	also be computed from each expert. The proposed algorithm was applied
	to the real case of a person authentication method using two modalities.
	Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed fusion method
	yielded a success rate of 99.5 percent, which significantly improved
	the quality of individual expert decision. The problem discussed
	in this paper is highly related with my project, particularly for
	decision fusion from several modalities with feature accumulation.
	Thus, the algorithm will be further studied.},

	of beat times through the whole piece that both places beats on moments

	method. Then, among %these f0 candidates, they constructed a melody
	trajectory by using some clues such as predominance, timbre, meter
	and fo's continuity. %However, the f0s of other predominant instruments
	performed concurrently with vocals were often detected because they
	did not assume what %a sound source was. The authors present a method
	for estimating f0s of vocal from polyphonic audio signals. This method
	consists of two ideas. First is to evaluate the probability that
	harmonic structure of each f0 candidate is vocal by using vocal and
	non-vocal GMMs. It is carried out by using accompaniment sound reduction.
	Specifically, they first extract and resynthesize the harmonic structure
	of each f0 candidate and extract feature vector from the resynthesized
	audio signal. Then, they evaluate the vocal probability according
	to Bayes rule. Second is to track vocal's f0 trajectory based on
	Viterbi search considering these vocal probabilities, which is conducted
	by modeling and formulating these stochastic dependency among a sequence
	of f0s, spectra and sound sources using a graphical model. The training
	data for vocal and non-vocal GMMs are collected from vocal section
	and interlude sections. Thus, the method of estimating vocal probability
	needs to be adapted so that it can be used for our project. }

	Based on the author's formulation, the standard techniques for speaker
	tracking is by M. S. Brandstein (A closed-form location estimator
	for use with room environment microphone arrays***). Previsouly,
	the authors have developed a speaker tracking system based on an
	extended Kalman filter by using time delays of arrival (TDOAs) as
	acoustic features. However, this system is limited to the scenario
	of tracking only a single speaker, althogh it has been extended by
	involving two modalities, namely, audio and video. To remove this
	restriction, the authors here generalized the iterated extended Kalman
	Filter (IEKF) to two aspects as follows: \begin{itemize} \item a
	probabilistic data associate filter. It can incorporate a clutter
	model used for rejection of spurious acoustic events, \item a joint
	probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), which is used to maintain
	a separate vector for each active speaker. THe JPDAF is able to track
	multiple, simultaneous speakers. From this point of view, it can
	be integrated to my project for multiple speaker tracking. \end{itemize}
	The proposed methods have been tested by a set of experiments conducted
	on seminar and meeting data. Results demonstrated that the JPDAF
	yielded improved performance over the IEKF. Problems: \begin{itemize}
	\item What's the definition of speaker tracking? \item How to tracking
	speakers? \item Which features are used to perform speaker tracking?
	\item How to track speakers by using multiple modalities? \item What
	are acoustic source localization scheme? What is time delay of arrival
	estimation (TDOA). The systems based on TDOA are conceptually simple,
	reasonably effective in moderately reverberant environment, and of
	low computational complexity leading to the well-suited real-time
	implementation with several sensors. \item What is time delay of
	arrival-based source localization? It is based on a two-step procedure:
	\begin{itemize} \item 1, Estimate the TDOA between all pairs of microphones,
	typically by finding the peak in a corss correlation or generalized
	cross correlation such as the phase transform (PHAT); \item 2, Calculate
	the squared-error between the estimated TDOAs and those determined
	from the source location, for a given source location. The stimated
	source location then corresponds to that position which minimizes
	this squared error. \end{itemize} \item How to integrate the audio
	localizer with video information? The authors have proposed an algorithm
	to incorporate detected face position in different camera views into
	the Kalman filter without doing any triangulation. Note the comparision
	this algorithm with those of Strobel et al (Joint Audio-video signal
	processing for object localization and tracking) and Welch and Bishop(
	SCAAT: Incremental tracking with incomplete information). For the
	Welch's method, the observations of the individual sensors were used
	to incrementally update the state of a Kalman filter. This combined
	approach yielded a robust source localizer that functioned reliably
	both for segments wherein the speaker was silent, which would have
	been detrimental for an audio only tracker, and wherein many faces
	appear, which would have confused a video only tracker (One problem
	regarding this method is how to deal with the situation while there
	are multiple speakers?). Also, this paper can serve as the foundation
	for my project since they have demonstrated that the audio-video
	localizer functioned bettern than a localizer based soley on audio
	or video features. \end{itemize}

  abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems.
	Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed
	as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system.
	The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines
	its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov
	random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an
	MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural
	mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics
	of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring,
	nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the
	posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image
	model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another
	(imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the
	physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what
	is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution.
	The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the
	maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded
	observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm
	for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm
	and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations
	are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

	engineering, and medical areas. Although traditionally used as input
	devices to virtual worlds, instrumented gloves may become the tools
	of choice to measure, monitor, and amplify upper-extremity motion.
	While we have identified potential clinical applications to VR input
	devices, many technological challenges must be met before such devices
	can be made available for patient care. The innovators in medical
	VR will be called upon to refine technical efficiency and increase
	physical and psychological comfort and capability, while keeping
	an eye to reducing costs for health care. The mandate is complex,
	but like VR technology itself, the possibilities are exciting and

	for statistical inference about the preferences of new users. Active
	learning strategies identify the most informative set of training
	examples through minimum interactions with the users. Current active
	learning approaches in CF make an implicit and unrealistic assumption
	that a user can provide rating for any queried item. This paper introduces
	a new approach to the problem which does not make such an assumption.
	We personalize active learning for the user, and query for only those
	items which the user can provide rating for. We propose an extended
	form of Bayesian active learning and use the Aspect Model for CF
	to illustrate and examine the idea. A comparative evaluation of the
	new method and a well-established baseline method on benchmark datasets
	shows statistically significant improvements with our method over
	the performance of the baseline method that is representative for
	existing approaches which do not take personalization into account.},

	with conventional linear predictive (LP) analysis, PLP analysis is
	more consistent with human hearing. The effective second formant
	F2 and the 3.5-Bark spectral-peak integration theories of vowel perception

	All value scores are known precisely. However, all that is known
	about the vector of trade-off weights is that it is a member of a
	given set, the trade-off weight set. A facilitator can ask questions
	and use the responses to update the trade-off weight set and hence
	the set of non-dominated alternatives, i.e., those alternatives that
	are candidates for being a most preferred alternative. The DM can
	terminate this process at any point. Termination typically occurs
	when the non-dominated set contains a sufficiently small number of
	alternatives.
	
	The facilitator's role is to ask questions that efficiently lead the
	DM to a most preferred alternative. The objective of this research
	is to aid the facilitator in selecting the best question to ask next.
	
	We model the question-response process as a sequential decision-making
	problem under uncertainty and develop a dynamic programming-based
	approach that guarantees a finite, and hence potentially computable,
	representation of the expected optimal cost-to-go function. An example

	Consequently, a more optimized GMM was found and it escaped from

	ML re-estimation was employed as the heuristic operator, which futher

	using a single camera, it included following steps: modeling of environments,
	detection of motion, classification of moving objects, tracking,
	understanding and description of behaviors, and human identification.
	To further extend the application and avoid occlusion, multiple cameras
	are needed. Motion detection is to segment regions related to moving
	objects from the rest of the image. It involves environment modeling,
	motion segmentation, and object classification. Traditional methods
	for motion segmentation are background subtraction, temporal differencing,
	and optical flow. And there are two categories for classifying moving
	objects, namely, shape-based classification and motion-based classification.
	Object tracking is to track the moving objects from one frame to
	another frame in an image sequence. The algorithms for tracking objects
	are categorized into four types, namely, region-based tracking, active-contour-based
	tracking, feature-based tracking, and model-based tracking. Regarding
	behavior understanding, it involves the analysis and recognition
	of motion patterns and production of description of high-level actions
	and interactions. The main methods for behavior understanding are
	dynamic time warping (DTW), finite-state machine (FSM), hidden Markov
	models (HMMs), time-delay neural network (TDNN), syntactic techniques,
	non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA), and self-organizing neural
	network. For personal identification, the recent methods can be categorized
	into five types, namely, model-based methods, statistical methods,
	physical-parameter-based methods, spatio-temporal motion-based methods,
	and fusion of gait with other biometrics. Multiple cameras can be
	employed to improve the performance of visual surveillance system,
	however, it caused other problems such as camera installation, camera
	calibration, object matching, automated camera switching, and data
	fusion. Currently, the open issues are as follows: occlusion handling,
	fusion of 2-D and 3-D tracking, three-dimensional modeling of humans
	and vehicles, combination of visual surveillance and personal identification
	behavior understanding, anomaly detection and behavior prediction,
	and content-based retrieval of surveillance videos, natural language
	description of object behaviors, fusion of data from multiple sensors,
	and remote surveillance.}

	independent beta random variables. Examples of random measures that
	have this characterization include the Dirichlet process, its two-parameter
	extension, the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process, finite dimensional
	Dirichlet priors, and beta two-parameter processes. The rich nature
	of stick-breaking priors offers Bayesians a useful class of priors
	for nonparametric problems, while the similar construction used in
	each prior can be exploited to develop a general computational procedure
	for fitting them. In this article we present two general types of
	Gibbs samplers that can be used to fit posteriors of Bayesian hierarchical
	models based on stick-breaking priors. The first type of Gibbs sampler,
	referred to as a Polya urn Gibbs sampler, is a generalized version
	of a widely used Gibbs sampling method currently employed for Dirichlet
	process computing. This method applies to stick-breaking priors with
	a known Polya urn characterization, that is, priors with an explicit
	and simple prediction rule. Our second method, the blocked Gibbs
	sampler, is based on an entirely different approach that works by
	directly sampling values from the posterior of the random measure.
	The blocked Gibbs sampler can be viewed as a more general approach
	because it works without requiring an explicit prediction rule. We
	find that the blocked Gibbs avoids some of the limitations seen with
	the Polya urn approach and should be simpler for nonexperts to use.},

	degree of accuracy over the weak limit approximation for the same

	respresenting a speaker's voice, these methods are based on the assumptions
	that the feature vectors are generated from underlying parametirc
	model, which is a multivariate Gaussian distribution. As a consequence,
	they can well fit the distribution function of the feature vectors.
	Compared to these parametric methods, the authors proposed a non-parametric
	modelling method based on the kernel deisntiy estimator. By using
	Gaussian kernel, this paper modeled feature vectors, Mel-Frequency
	Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), of 0.5s length from HTIMIT using non-parametric
	model. The performances were reported and compared with a corresponding
	Gaussian Mixture Model between a clean environment and the presence
	of noise at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5dB. Compared with GMM,
	the resutls domenstrated the proposed non-parametric model can lead
	to a 20 percent reduction in the equal error probability. No other
	kernel functions were employed and compared with the parametric modelling,
	thus they were listed as the furture work.}

  abstract = {A multitask learning framework is developed for discriminative classification
	and regression where multiple large-margin linear classifiers are
	estimated for different prediction problems. These classifiers operate
	in a common input space but are coupled as they recover an unknown
	shared representation. A maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework
	is used to derive the multitask algorithm which involves only convex
	optimization problems that are straightforward to implement. Three
	multitask scenarios are described. The first multitask method produces
	multiple support vector machines that learn a shared sparse feature
	selection over the input space. The second multitask method produces
	multiple support vector machines that learn a shared conic kernel
	combination. The third multitask method produces a pooled classifier
	as well as adaptively specialized individual classifiers. Furthermore,
	extensions to regression, graphical model structure estimation and
	other sparse methods are discussed. The maximum entropy optimization
	problems are implemented via a sequential quadratic programming method
	which leverages recent progress in fast SVM solvers. Fast monotonic
	convergence bounds are provided by bounding the MED sparsifying cost
	function with a quadratic function and ensuring only a constant factor
	runtime increase above standard independent SVM solvers. Results
	are shown on multitask data sets and favor multitask learning over
	single-task or tabula rasa methods.},

	The classification performance for all of these features are at most
	83 percent. Experimental results indicate that MFCCs based on linear

	significant improvement over MFCCs based on the simpler FFT. From

	patterns of a group of users to predict the utility of items for

	The more the number of rated examples given by the active user, the

	an effective way to acquire the most informative rated examples from
	active users. Previous work on active learning for collaborative

	of the posterior distribution of the estimated model, which results
	in more robust active learning algorithm. Empirical studies with
	datasets of movie ratings show that when the number of ratings from
	the active user is restricted to be small, active learning methods

	environments. Based on wavelet transformation, the authors proposed
	a new features, namely, wavelet energy (WE). The WE is capable of
	reducing the influences of different types of noise at different
	levels. The calculation of WE is based on the Harr wavelet. By comparing
	the variance of WE with different scales at different SNR, the WE
	at scale of 6 is select because it achieve the smallest variance.
	ZCR is also used as a detection parameter because it is particularly
	suitable for un-voiced detection due to the high-frequency nature
	of the majority of fricatives. By using these two features, a detector
	is proposed by using Singleton-type recurrent nerual fuzzy network
	(SRNFN) with two external inputs and a single output. Three groups
	of experiments under different environments have been conducted to
	evaluate the performance. The first one deals with white noise at
	different SNR. The second one studied the influence of unknown noise
	including engine room, babble, and cockpit noise. The third one used
	a larger speech database and different SNR was used. The proposed
	method was compared with WE-based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type recurrent
	fuzzy network (TRFN), WE-based SVM, and recurrent self-organizing
	neural fuzzy inference network (RSONFIN). Experimental results demonstrate
	the superiority of the proposed method. However, the good detection
	rate of 92.66 with SNR of 20 is suspicious since there is only a
	total of 30 Mandarin words included for the speech database. This
	paper is highly related with my research, particularly for the proposed
	feature WE. Note that the language under investigation is Mandarin,
	so the ability of WE on the noise for English has to be studied before
	straightforward application.\\
	
	 As for the difference with my project, the assumptions are different.
	The assumption of this paper is that the input signal is noise and
	speech in noisy environments. However, the assumption for my project
	is that the input signal is unknown. Based different assumptions,
	the proposed features can not be directly applied to my problem.
	Before using, the feature should be checked so that we know whether
	the WE is robust when speech is mixed with music, or song.}

	silhouette of a walking person is chosen as the image feature. A
	set of exemplars that occur during an activity cycle is chosen for
	each individual. Using these exemplars, a lower dimensional frame-to-exemplar
	distance (FED) vector is generated. A continuous HMM is trained using
	several such FED vector sequences. This methodology serves to capture
	compactly structural and dynamic features that are unique to an individual.
	The statistical nature of the HMM renders overall robustness to representation
	and recognition. Human identification performance of the proposed
	scheme is found to be quite good when tested on outdoor video sequences
	collected using surveillance cameras.},

	combined the local dicision to obtain a global decision, which minimized

	proposed a system for tracking people in 3D space by utilizing audiovisual
	information acuqired from acoustic and video sensors. Specifically,
	the video subsystem was developed by the combination of a number
	of 2D trackers based on an alternative of Stauffer's adaptive background
	algorithm with spacio-temporal adaption of the learning parameters
	and a Kalman tracker in a feedback configuration. As for audio subsystem,
	it employed an information theorectic metric upon a pair of microphones
	to estimate the direction from which sound was arrived from. Then,
	the information from these two modalities were integrated using a
	Kalman filter. The proposed system has been tested in the CLEAR evaluations.
	There were some unexpected results as follows: \begin{itemize} \item
	The results of the video-only were far better for the multi person
	tracking subtask than the single person one. An preliminary explanation
	was that the results were impacted by the audience, who were not
	to be tracked. \item The presence of multiple speakers did not significantly
	degrade the performance of audio tracking subsystem. Compared with
	mutiple speaker identification, this result was incredible since
	it is difficult to identify person based on his/her voice when multiple
	persons were speaking simultaneously. \item The fusion of audiovisual
	modalities yielded worse performance than any of the audio subsystem
	and video subsystem. The author did not put the reason for this phenomenon.
	On the contrary, the performance of speaker recognition can alway
	be improved by integrating video modality. \end{itemize} Based on
	the current understanding, it is quite different task for speaker
	tracking and continuous speaker identification. Speaker tracking
	is to locate the real-time position of the specific speaker while
	continuous speaker identification is to recognize who is speaking.
	Despite the difference, the method in speaker tracking can still
	be improved for use in continuous speaker identification. Also, one
	of the potential method may be Kalman filter. As a consequence I
	will investigate it soon. Also, one possible project is to combine
	the speaker tracking and speaker identification. By doing so, the
	speaker can be located and recognized continuously, however, one
	challenge is the speaker recognition when the sound are mixed from
	several persons. }

	classifier based on continuous hidden Markov models is applied. The
	sound model state path, which is selected according to the maximum-likelihood
	model, is stored in an MPEG-7 sound database and used as an index
	for query applications. Various experiments are presented where the
	speaker- and sound-recognition rates are compared for different feature

	better results than normalized audio spectrum envelope and principal

	in multipitch estimation and sound separation. Here, it is assumed
	that the spectral envelopes of real sound sources tend to be continuous.
	This papers presents evidence for the importance of spectral smoothness
	both in human and computational MPE, and three algorithms to implement
	this principle. The aim of the spectral smoothness algorithm is to
	use the pitch information to produce a more appropriate estimate
	for the spectrum of a separated sound before it is subtracted from
	the mixture. Experiments were conducted using an experimental model,
	where the spectral smoothness was either used in different ways,
	or was completely ignored. The data set comprises sung vowels and
	the whole pitch range of 26 musical instruments. By including spectral
	smoothness, the pitch error rate in random four-voice mixture dropped
	from 18 percent to 8.1 percent, and in musical four-voice mixtures
	from 25 percent to 12 percent. It indicates that it is useful to
	include spectral smoothness for MPE. From the signal seperation point
	of view, the audio events detection problem can be described as follows:
	Given an audio clip, our aim is to seperate the single audio event
	of interest. One method to seperate single audio events from a mixture
	of multiple streams is as follows: First, it is to find the pitch
	of the most prominent sound in the interference of other harmonic
	and noisy sounds. Second, estimate the precise frequencies and amplitudes
	of the harmonics partials of the prominent sound. Third, the spectrum
	of the detected sound is linearly subtracted from the mixture. These
	operations are then repeated for the residual signals. Now, suppose
	we have separated and got three of the most prominent sound events,
	the problem of audio events detection is to decide whether the separated
	sound events is those of interested. However, the method faces difficulties
	in three circumstances, 1) multi-speakers, 2) multi-notes, 3) multi-instruments,
	and 4) inharmonics of unvoiced speech. Although we can first assume
	that the component of mixture is from single speaker, single note,
	and single instruments, this framework is difficult to be extended
	for handling the three cased mentioned above.}

	to CF is based on neighborhood models, which originate from similarities
	between products or users. In this work we introduce a new neighborhood
	model with an improved prediction accuracy. Unlike previous approaches
	that are based on heuristic similarities, we model neighborhood relations
	by minimizing a global cost function. Further accuracy improvements
	are achieved by extending the model to exploit both explicit and
	implicit feedback by the users. Past models were limited by the need
	to compute all pairwise similarities between items or users, which
	grow quadratically with input size. In particular, this limitation
	vastly complicates adopting user similarity models, due to the typical
	large number of users. Our new model solves these limitations by
	factoring the neighborhood model, thus making both item-item and
	user-user implementations scale linearly with the size of the data.
	The methods are tested on the Netflix data, with encouraging results.},

	the circumstance of short speech segments. Although the performance
	of automatic speaker identification proved to be promising by using
	traditional methods for adquate long segments, 2s or more, the performance
	degraded when the speech segments were shorter. Based on the analysis
	of the speaker models, the authors claimed that the recogniton error
	was due to the overlap among speaker models caused by noise and similar
	acoustic characteristics from speakers, especially for the short
	speech segments. To mitigate the influence of these features causing
	overlap between speaker models, this paper proposed a method that
	employs only the features which did not cause overlap between speaker
	models for the speaker recognition. The authors assumed that the
	number of speakers is less than 8. The experiments were conducted
	on Speaker Recognitin Benchmark NIST Speech (1999) corpus and speakers
	were recognized using relatively short speech segments of 0.25, 0.5,
	1 and 2s. The results demonstrated that the proposed method yielded
	good performance. Compared with the baseline GMM and GMM with LDA,
	the new method yielded improvement of 20-51 percent and 15-30 percent,
	respectively. Although the performance of the proposed method was
	superior, more experiments should be performed with different number

	speaker indexing, which sequentially detected points where a speaker
	identity changed in a multispeaker audio stream, and categorized
	each speaker segment, without any prior knowledge about the speakers.
	Regarding the unsupervised speaker indexing, there are two challenges.
	The first is relevant to sequential speaker change detection. The
	second relates to speaker modeling in light of the fact that the
	number/identity of the speakers is unknown. To address these issues,
	the authors proposed a predetermined generic speaker-independent
	model set, namely, the sample speaker models (SSM). This set can
	be used for more accurate speaker modeling and clustering without
	requiring training models on target speaker data. Once a speaker-independent
	model is selected from the generic sample models, it will be progressively
	adapted into a specific speaker-dependent model. By conducting experiments
	on the data from the Speaker Recognition Benchmark NIST Speech corpus
	(1999) and the HUB-4 Broadcast News Evaluation English Test material
	(1999), the results indicated that the new techniques, sampled using
	the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, yielded 92.5 percent indexing
	accuracy on two speaker telephone conversations, 89.6 percent on
	four-speaker conversations with the telephone speech quality, and
	87.2 percent on broadcast news. Furthermore, the proposed method
	has been compared with the universal background model (UBM) and the
	universal gender models (UGM). Results showed that the proposed method
	outperformed the UBM by up to 29.4 percent and the UGM by up to 22.5

	into homogeneous audio segments, each of which has a unique sound
	type such as speech or music. The audio track was uniformly segmented
	into nonoverlapping 1-s clips, 26 features were extracted to represent

	model (GMM) and updating it on the fly, a statistical approach is
	used to extract discussion scenes in the video. Finally, the discussion
	scenes were categorized into either two-speaker or multispeaker discussions
	by using an adaptive model-based clustering approach. The experiments
	have been conducted on four training videos and five IBM MicroMBA

	the insufficiency of training data and time caused by transcribing
	training data of the widely used supervised identification methods,
	the authors proposed an adaptive speaker identification system, which
	updated the speaker models by adapting to the newly input data. The

	The audio features included short-time energy function, short-time
	average zero-crossing rate (ZCR), short-time fundamental frequency
	(SFuF), energy band ratio (EBR) and silence ratio (SR). For audio
	sources, a likelihood-based approach was used to recognize the speaker
	based on the audio content. For the visual sources, the face detection
	\& recognition and mouth tracking techniques were used to recognize
	the talking faces. This system proved to be promising based on the
	extensive experiments conducted on two movies, ``When Harry Met Sally"
	and ``The Legend of the Fall". Although this method yielded good
	performance, one bottleneck of the system was its face detection
	module since it can only handle the upright frontal faces or faces
	rotated by $\pm10$ degree from the vertical faces. Thus, the modules

  abstract = {Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a matrix decompo- sition algorithm
	that returns the optimal (in the sense of squared error) low-rank
	decomposition of a matrix. SVD has found widespread use across a
	variety of machine learn- ing applications, where its output is interpreted
	as compact and informative representations of data. The Netflix Prize
	challenge, and collaborative filtering in general, is an ideal application
	for SVD, since the data is a matrix of ratings given by users to
	movies. It is thus not surprising to ob- serve that most currently
	successful teams use SVD, either with an extension, or to interpolate
	with results returned by other algorithms. Unfortunately SVD can
	easily overfit due to the extreme data sparsity of the matrix in
	the Net- flix Prize challenge, and care must be taken to regularize
	properly.
	
	In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to alleviate overfitting
	in SVD, where priors are introduced and all pa- rameters are integrated
	out using variational inference. We show experimentally that this
	gives significantly improved results over vanilla SVD. For truncated
	SVDs of rank 5, 10, 20, and 30, our proposed Bayesian approach achieves
	2.2\% improvement over a na ÌÄ±ve approach, 1.6\% improvement over
	a gradient descent approach dealing with unobserved entries properly,

	method made use of a bottom-up SVM over these acoustical features
	and additional features, such as frequency cepstral coefficients.
	The authors investigated two kernel functions, namely, Exponential
	Radial Basis Function (ERBF) and Gaussian function. Experiments have
	been conducted by using a public audio database (Muscle Fish), which
	consists of 410 sounds in 16 classes. Experimental results showed

	2 matches, respectively. In addition, the best classification results
	with an ERBF kernel was six misclassifications, which was significantly
	bettern than the 13 misclassifications produced by the Gaussian kernel.

	three steps. First, it extracted soundtrack (PCM data) from video
	stream and partitioned the soundtrack into homogeneous segments by
	using rule and support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. The
	rule-based classifier separated an audio clip into silences and nonsilence
	ones. Then for these non-silence sub-clips, SVMs are employed to
	classify them into three classes: speech, music and environmental
	sound. Furthermore, the nonsilence sub-clip was classified into speech
	and non-speech classes, and then the non-speech was further classified
	into music and environmental sound. Second, based on spectral clustering,
	the fixed-length speech clips (for example 2s) randomly selected
	from speech segments were clustered into several clusters. Speech
	clustering was based on the analysis of a similarity matrix. Kullback-Leibler
	Divergence was used as the similiarity measure. Here, the clustered
	speech feature datasets initialize and train GMMs for each speaker.
	Finally, speaker identification was performed based on the trained
	GMMs. The audio features used in the scheme consisted of short-time
	energy, zero-crossing rate, sub-band energy, sub-band energy ratio,
	and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). Experimental testing
	system was builted on AFsp, libmad, HTK, libSVM, matrix and Torch.

	is that the audio classification is processed in two steps. The first
	step is to perform speech and nonspeech discrimination by using a
	novel algorithm based on K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) and linear spectral
	pairs-vector quantization (LSP-VQ). The second step further divided
	nonspeech class into music, environment sounds, and silence with
	a rule-based classification scheme. In addition, the authors presented
	a set of new features such as high zero-crossing rate ratio, low
	short-time energy ratio, spectrum flux, band periodicity, nosie frame
	ratio, linear spectral pairs (LSP) distance measure. As for audio
	segmentation, the authors proposed an unsupervised speaker segmentation
	algorithm by using a novel scheme based on quasi-GMM and LSP correlation
	analysis. Without a priori knowledge, this approach can support the
	open-set speaker, online speaker modeling, and real time segmentation.
	The evaluation of the proposed audio classification and segmentation

	clips from the Internet. Experimental results showed that the proposed

	rate of 96 percent. Future work included the expansion of audio classes,
	and the algorithm for speaker segmentation is expected to improve
	for speaker tracking. In addition, an effective scheme is expected
	to be developed, which applies audio content analysis to assist video

  abstract = {Quantization, the process of approximating continuous-amplitude signals
	by digital (discrete-amplitude) signals, is an important aspect of
	data compression or coding, the field concerned with the reduction
	of the number of bits necessary to transmit or store analog data,
	subject to a distortion or fidelity criterion. The independent quantization
	of each signal value or parameter is termed scalar quantization,
	while the joint quantization of a block of parameters is termed block
	or vector quantization. This tutorial review presents the basic concepts
	employed in vector quantization and gives a realistic assessment
	of its benefits and costs when compared to scalar quantization. Vector
	quantization is presented as a process of redundancy removal that
	makes effective use of four interrelated properties of vector parameters:
	linear dependency (correlation), nonlinear dependency, shape of the
	probability density function (pdf), and vector dimensionality itself.
	In contrast, scalar quantization can utilize effectively only linear
	dependency and pdf shape. The basic concepts are illustrated by means
	of simple examples and the theoretical limits of vector quantizer
	performance are reviewed, based on results from rate-distortion theory.
	Practical issues relating to quantizer design, implementation, and
	performance in actual applications are explored. While many of the
	methods presented are quite general and can be used for the coding
	of arbitrary signals, this paper focuses primarily on the coding
	of speech signals and parameters.}

	Traditionally, fusion methods included processing biometric modalities

	from separate classifiers fro each modality. In this paper, the author
	proposed a novel fusion architecture based on Bayesian belief networks
	(BBN). This approach exploited the graphical structure of Bayes nets
	to define and model statistical dependencies between relevant variables,
	namely, per sample measurements, such as match scores and corresponding
	quality estimates, and global decision variables. These statistical
	dependencies were in the form of conditional distributions, which
	were modeled as Gaussian, gamma, log-normal or beta distribution.
	Each of these distrubtions was decided by its mean and variance,
	thus the selected models reduced significantly the training data
	requirements. The proposed method has been used to fuse fingerprints
	and voice on the fingerprint data from the NIST, and unpublished
	government-owned database of fingerprints collected during field
	operation. The employment of BBN for information fusion was first
	proposed in this paper. Based on the description in this paper, I
	need to further investigate BBN to study the possibility of application
	in my project.},

	The first is to define a local measure of the uncertainty using the
	theory of bandit problems. We show that such a measure suffers from
	several drawbacks. In particular, a direct application of it leads
	to algorithms of low quality that can be easily misled by particular
	configurations of the environment. The second basic principle was
	introduced to eliminate this drawback. It consists of assimilating
	the local measures of uncertainty to rewards, and back-propagating
	them with the dynamic programming or temporal difference mechanisms.
	This allows reproducing global-scale reasoning about the uncertainty,
	using only local measures of it. Numerical simulations clearly show
	the efficiency of these propositions.},

  source = {This paper discusses the problem of face recognition, particularly
	the effect of facial expression. An efficient multimodal (2D and
	3D) hybrid approach was proposed to achieve efficiency and robustness
	to facial expressions. To correct the pose of a 3D face along with
	its texture, a novel approach based on a single automatically detected
	point and Hotelling transform was proposed. In addition, by combining
	a novel 3D Spherical Face Representation (SFR) with the Scale-Invariant
	Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor, the authors designed a rejection
	classifier to quickly eliminate a large number of candidate faces
	at an early stage for efficient recognition in case of large galleries.
	Then, a novel region-based matching approach, robust to facial expression,
	was used to verify the remaining faces. Specifically, this approach
	automatically segmented the eyes-forehead and the nose regions, two
	regions relatively less sensitive to expressions, and matched them
	separately using a modified Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.
	Information fusion from all the matching engines was performed at
	the metric level leading to higher accuracy. The proposed algorithm
	was tested on the FRGC v2.0 data. For probes with a neutral and a
	nonneutral expression, the proposed method yielded 99.74 percent
	and 98.31 percent verification rates at a 0.001 false acceptance
	rate (FAR) and identification rates of 99.02 percent and 95.37 percent,
	respectively. The results proved its superority to other algorithms
	such as the baseline PCA performance.}

	of the divergence, local to each factor. By examining these divergence
	measures, we can intuit the types of solution they prefer (symmetry-breaking,

	Examples of such problems include utility maximization, MAP inference,

	inference from scratch can be massively redundant. In this paper,

	affected by the changes. We provide theoretical guarantees bounding
	the difference in beliefs generated by EFBP and standard BP, and
	apply EFBP to the problem of expected utility maximization in influence

	that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by
	alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform
	sampling from the horizontal ``slice'' defined by the current vertical
	position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform
	distribution over this slice invariant. Such ``slice sampling'' methods
	are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used
	to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable
	in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling
	and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability
	of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made.
	It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling
	methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible.
	These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made
	to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function.
	More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies
	between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations.
	Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing
	random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by ``overrelaxation,''
	and for multivariate slice sampling by ``reflection'' from the edges
	of the slice.},

	Related problems in other fields have been tackled using Monte Carlo
	methods based on sampling using Markov chains, providing a rich array
	of techniques that can be applied to problems in artificial intelligence.
	The "Metropolis algorithm" has been used to solve difficult problems
	in statistical physics for over forty years, and, in the last few
	years, the related method of "Gibbs sampling" has been applied to
	problems of statistical inference. Concurrently, an alternative method
	for solving problems in statistical physics by means of dynamical
	simulation has been developed as well, and has recently been unified
	with the Metropolis algorithm to produce the "hybrid Monte Carlo"
	method. In computer science, Markov chain sampling is the basis of
	the heuristic optimization technique of "simulated annealing", and
	has recently been used in randomized algorithms for approximate counting
	of large sets.
	
	
	In this review, I outline the role of probabilistic inference in artificial
	intelligence, and present the theory of Markov chains, and describe
	various Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, along with a number
	of supporting techniques. I try to present a comprehensive picture
	of the range of methods that have been developed, including techniques

	The authors presented a hierarchical decision fusion approach of
	facial feature as well as audio and viseme in the text-dependent
	mode. For the face and audio, the features were nine 2D discrete
	Cosine transform (2D DCT) coefficients and 13 Mel frequency cepstral
	coefficients (MFCC) with their first and second order time derivatives,
	respectively. To acquire the features of the visual speech, the mouth
	region was first mapped to a 32-dimension vector using Principal
	Component Analysis (PCA), and blocks for 15 consecutive visual observation
	vectors were concatenated and projected on a linear discriminant
	space with 13 class. The resulting vectors together with their first
	and second order time derivatives formed the visual speech features.
	The fusion approach can be formulated at two levels. For the lower
	level, the face features were modelled using the embedded hidden
	Markov models (EHMM) with 5 super states and 3,6,6,6,3 states for
	each state; the audio-viseme features were integrated by the coupled
	hidden Markov models (CHMM) with 3 states for both the audio and
	video chains. Then, a late integration of likelihood of face and
	audio-viseme was performed to yield the identity of the speaker.
	With the experiments on XM2VTS database in environment at different
	signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 5dB to 30dB, the authors
	claimed that the proposed system outperformed the audio-only, visual-only
	and audio-viseme fusion systems. Furthermore, the results indicated
	that the proposed system was much more robust to acoustic noise.\\
	The essence of EHMM and CHMM with their traning method need to be
	further investigated in order to be used in my project.},

	28 features are extracted from the estimated pitch and pitch reliability.
	Pitch reliability is the value by dividing the total energy in the
	HPS with the maximum peak in HPS. Four of the 28 features described
	in details are \begin{itemize} \item Standard deviation of pitch
	reliability: standard deviation of pitch reliability shows good separation
	of all classes with speech having high values, noise low and music
	in between. \item Difference between subsequent pitch samples: difference
	between subsequent pitch samples describes the dynamical property
	of the pitch. It is good for separating music from speech and noise,
	because music has many constant pitch parts and therefore a high
	pitch difference value. \item Tone distance: tone distance is the
	distance from the pitch of a 12'th octave musical note. It is good
	for separating the music from speech and noise. \item Pitch change:
	pitch change feature measures the difference between the highest
	and the lowest pitch in a reliable window. \end{itemize} The classification
	model is based on the soft-max output function due to its simplicity.
	This paper motivates to use statistical representation of pitch.

	the data sparsity problem in a target domain by transferring knowledge

	as, for instance, robot navigation, are naturally defined on continuous
	spaces. In this work, we demonstrate that the value function for

	that continuous Bellman backups are contracting and isotonic ensuring

	on those properties, we extend the algorithm, originally developed
	for discrete POMDPs, to work in continuous state spaces by representing
	the observation, transition, and reward models using Gaussian mixtures,
	and the beliefs using Gaussian mixtures or particle sets. With these
	representations, the integrals that appear in the Bellman backup
	can be computed in closed form and, therefore, the algorithm is computationally
	feasible. Finally, we further extend to deal with continuous action

	providing a richer prior, the posterior distribution of mixture assignments
	reveals the latent classes. Using Gibbs sampling for inference, we

  abstract = {The basic theory of Markov chains has been known to mathematicians
	and engineers for close to 80 years, but it is only in the past decade
	that it has been applied explicitly to problems in speech processing.
	One of the major reasons why speech models, based on Markov chains,
	have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for
	optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal
	patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately
	applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued
	refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling
	techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range
	of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial
	paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models, and
	to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.}

  abstract = {Tagging plays an important role in many recent websites. Recommender
	systems can help to suggest a user the tags he might want to use
	for tagging a specific item. Factor- ization models based on the
	Tucker Decomposition (TD) model have been shown to provide high quality
	tag recom- mendations outperforming other approaches like PageRank,
	FolkRank, collaborative filtering, etc. The problem with TD models
	is the cubic core tensor resulting in a cubic runtime in the factorization
	dimension for prediction and learning.
	
	
	In this paper, we present the factorization model PITF (Pairwise Interaction
	Tensor Factorization) which is a spe- cial case of the TD model with
	linear runtime both for learn- ing and prediction. PITF explicitly
	models the pairwise interactions between users, items and tags. The
	model is learned with an adaption of the Bayesian personalized rank-
	ing (BPR) criterion which originally has been introduced for item
	recommendation. Empirically, we show on real world datasets that
	this model outperforms TD largely in run- time and even can achieve
	better prediction quality. Besides our lab experiments, PITF has
	also won the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 for graph-based tag
	recommenda- tion.},

	(Srebro et al., 2005) as a convex, infinite dimensional alternative
	to low-rank approximations and standard factor models. MMMF can be
	formulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) and learned using
	standard SDP solvers. However, current SDP solvers can only handle
	MMMF problems on matrices of dimensionality up to a few hundred.
	Here, we investigate a direct gradient-based optimization method
	for MMMF and demonstrate it on large collaborative prediction problems.
	We compare against results obtained by Marlin (2004) and find that
	MMMF substantially outperforms all nine methods he tested.},

	Previous work in face detection mainly used the methods of artifical
	neural network, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Bayesian inference,
	deformable templates as well as graph-matching and skin color. To
	solve this problem, a hierarchical face detection algorithm was proposed
	based on the SVM classifiers which can reject background rapid in
	most parts of the images and process the area containing faces finely.
	To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, it was firstly
	trained using 2000 faces synthesized from the 400 faces of 40 individuals
	from Olivetti database. Then, the system was tested using 100 images
	from the CMU+MIT database and 100 images from the online CMU web
	demo. The results indicated that the proposed method can reject background
	pattern faster and yeild a detection of 87.6 percent with a missed
	face rate of 13 percent. The authors also claimed that the proposed
	method was computationally efficienct based on the comparison with
	f-network.},

	five covariances on recognition performance. The five covariates
	included change in view angle, change in shoe type, change in walking

	Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index
	sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse
	range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various
	properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian
	processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics
	relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches
	such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which
	similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are
	routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are
	attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational
	simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical
	methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties
	in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as
	nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational
	scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic
	sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs
	is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully
	understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper,
	we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning
	and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular
	in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references

	more voices and determine their pitch. The authors present a framework
	for real-time pitch determination. The feature is instantaneous frequency
	estimation, a method for tracking the partials of voices speech.
	The classifier is based on nonnegative matrix factorization, an unsupervised
	algorithm for learning the parts of complex objects. The proposed
	framework was tested using two databases, namely, the Keele database
	and the Edinburgh database. Based on these data sets, the authors
	compared the proposed method with a robust algorithm for pitch tracking
	(RAPT). Four error types are reported: the percentage of voiced frames
	misclassified as unvoiced (VE), the percentage of unvoiced frames
	misclassified as voice (UE), the percentage of voiced frames with
	gross pitch errors (GPE) where predicted and reference $f_{0}$ values
	differ by more than 20 percent, and the root-mean-squared difference
	between predicted and reference $f_{0}$ values when there are no
	gross pitch errors. Experimental results suggest that the proposed
	method is comparable to that of RAPT.
	
	 This paper relates with my project in terms of methodology. Our problem
	is to detect the presence of audio events of interests. By extending
	voices in this paper to audio events, the method proposed in this
	paper is amendable to be used for our problem. One by-product by
	using this method is that we can also get the pitch for audio events.
	By doing so, we can claim: \begin{itemize} \item A general framework
	for audio events detection. Here, the audio events may include speech,
	music, song, etc. \item The estimation of the strength for each audio
	events. Here, the strength for each audio events is the coefficient
	of corresponding basis functions. \end{itemize} Some advantages of
	the proposed method are as follows: \begin{itemize} \item Operation
	with overlapping speakers \item Real-time processing \item Statistical
	learning of basis function \end{itemize} Some disadvantages of the
	proposed method are as follows: \begin{itemize} \item Not robust
	to noise \item How to deal with the case when the number of sound
	sources is unknown. \item An alternative step is needed to detect
	the unvoiced speech. \end{itemize} }

	discuessed the problem of face detection and proposed an approach
	for effective face detection by combining the discriminating feature
	analysis (DFA), face class modelling and support vector machines
	(SVM). The proposed framework included the following steps: \begin{itemize}
	\item A discriminating feature vector was derived from the combination
	of the input image, its 1-D Harr wavelet represenatation and its
	amplitude projections. \item A face class was modelled using a multivariate
	normal distribution, which defined a distribution-based measure for
	classifying the input pattern into three class: the face class as
	well as the non-face class and undecided class. \item The undecide
	class was further classified by SVM and distribution-based measure.
	\end{itemize} To study the feasibility of the proposed system, it
	was trained using 600 FERET facial images and 3813 nonface images
	and tested using 92 images from MIT-CMU test sets. Based on a correct
	face detecton rate of 98.2 percent and two false detection, the authors
	claimed that the proposed method was promising. Furthermore, the
	performance was compared with Schneiderman-Kanades's (SK) method
	and proved to be more effective based on its higher correct face
	detection rates and lower false detection rates. However, the false
	detections for the SK method was lower than the proposed method when
	the frontal detection threshold was set to 3.0, which weakened the
	author's conclusion. No explanation was given for this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Decision models involving continuous probability distributions almost
	always require some form of approximation. The usual approach to
	evaluating these kinds of models is to construct a discrete approximation
	for each continuous distribution and compute value lotteries and
	certain equivalents using these discrete approximations. Although
	decision analysts are quite comfortable with this approach, there
	has been relatively little consideration of how these discrete approximations
	affect the results of the analysis. In the first part of this paper,
	we review three common methods of constructing discrete approximations
	and compare their performance in a simple example. The results of
	the example suggest a different approach that offers potential improvements
	in accuracy and efficiency over the usual approach. The basic idea
	is that given discrete approximations that accurately represent the
	moments of assessed "input" distributions, we may easily and accurately
	compute the moments of the "output" distribution or value lotteries.
	These moments then summarize what we know about the value lottery
	and certain equivalent, and provide the basis for computing approximate
	value lotteries and certain equivalents. In this paper, we discuss
	the methods supporting this moment approach and evaluate their performance
	in the context of the example.},

	features of speakers and perform speaker recognition based on the
	minimum distance classifier. Linear prediction coefficients (LPC)
	feature vectors of dimension 9 were used to form the codebook. The
	proposed method was verified using a 100 speaker recognition experiments
	leading to a recognition of over 98 percent with a codebook of 64
	and a 10 digits long test token. Specifically, five experiments were
	designed to compare effect of codebook size and number of digits
	in the test token, repeat digits and different digits, using only
	voiced speech and different sessions. The conclusions from the results
	of five experiments can be summarized as follows: \begin{itemize}
	\item Longer test token and large codebook can improve the recognition
	rate. \item Test token with phoentically rich content yields higher
	performance than those with low phoentical content. \item If the
	unvoiced frames were used to train the codebook, these frames should
	also be used during the testing procedure. \item Due to the intra-speaker
	viriations and different recording condition, the codebook should
	be updated in order to yield high recognition rate. \end{itemize}

	which has an underlying structured probabilistic nature. The postures
	that the individual adopts can be regarded as the states of the HMM
	and are typical to that individual and provide a means of discrimination.
	The framework assumes that, during gait, the individual transitions
	between N discrete postures or states but it is not dependent on
	the particular feature vector used to represent the gait information
	contained in the postures. The framework, thus, provides flexibility
	in the selection of the feature vector. The statistical nature of
	the HMM lends robustness to the model. In this paper we use the binarized
	background-subtracted image as the feature vector and use different
	distance metrics, such as those based on the L/sub 1/ and L/sub 2/
	norms of the vector difference, and the normalized inner product
	of the vectors, to measure the similarity between feature vectors.
	The results we obtain are better than the baseline recognition rates

	on recognizing the lexical (or citation) form of sign gestures, as

	scale well to large vocabularies. However, successful recognition
	of lexical signs is not sufficient for a full understanding of sign
	language communication. Nonmanual signals and grammatical processes,
	which result in systematic variations in sign appearance, are integral
	aspects of this communication but have received comparatively little
	attention in the literature. In this survey, we examine data acquisition,
	feature extraction and classification methods employed for the analysis
	of sign language gestures. These are discussed with respect to issues
	such as modeling transitions between signs in continuous signing,
	modeling inflectional processes, signer independence, and adaptation.
	We further examine works that attempt to analyze nonmanual signals
	and discuss issues related to integrating these with (hand) sign
	gestures. We also discuss the overall progress toward a true test
	of sign recognition systems -dealing with natural signing by native
	signers. We suggest some future directions for this research and
	also point to contributions it can make to other fields of research.

	time-varying distance signals calculated from a sequence of sihouette

	Sinusoidal trajectories represent the temporal characteristics, and
	was extracted by a locally optimal tracking method composed of a
	dynamic programming (DP) step and an interative improvement step.
	From each trajectory, 20 temporal features were extracted acoustic
	features. The classification and detection of a temporal mixture
	of speech and music are performed by a statistical integration of
	the 20 features and the optimization of the combination of their
	categories. 400 samples of mixed sounds were used to evaluate the

	result shows the superiority of the proposed method.\\
	
	 Two points are related with my project. The assumption for this paper
	is different from my project. This paper assumes that the input signal
	is speech mixed by music. As a consequence, we need to validate the
	influence of song on the 20 features from spectral tracking. These
	20 features could be applied only if they are still discriminative

	Compared with the current preprocessing methods such as principal
	component analysis (PCA) and the two-dimensional LDA (2DLDA), the
	proposed GDTA has three strengths 1) it reduced the USP, 2) the discriminative
	information in the traning tensors was perserved, and 3) GTDA yielded
	stable recognition rates due to the convergence when obtaining a
	solution of GTDA using projection optimization algorithm. Furthermore,
	the authors proposed three different Gabor-function-based image representations,
	namely, GaborD, GaborS, and GaborSD. To perform gait recognition,
	the first step was to obtain a Gabor, GaborD, Gabors, or GaborSD
	image representation. Next, GDTA was used to extract features. Finally,
	LDA was used for classification. Experiments are conducted on the
	image sequences from the USF HumanID Database. Results of experimental

	If the value computed for the original data is significantly different

	to face uncertainty with respect to their disposable incomes. To
	analyse effects of this uncertainty, a stochastic dynamic growth
	model with the public sector is examined. It is shown that deterministic
	excessive red tape and corruption deteriorate the growth potential
	through income redistribution and public sector inefficiencies. Most
	importantly, it is demonstrated that the increase in corruption via
	higher uncertainty exerts adverse effects on capital accumulation,
	thus leading to lower growth rates.},

	scheme. They presented two dissimilarity measures for selecting the
	LDB nodes and extracting features from them. The extracted features
	were fed to a linear discriminant analysis-based classifier for a
	three-level hierarchical classification of audio signals into ten
	classes. The audio signals were divided into artificial and natural
	sounds in the first level. Each of the first level groups was subdivided
	into the second level groups including instrumental, automobile,
	human, and nonhuman sounds. The third level was formed by subdividing
	the four groups of the second level into the final ten categories,
	namely, drums, flute, piano, aircraft, helicopter, male, female,
	animals, birds and insects. The dataset used for experiments is a
	database of 213 audio signals. The proposed scheme achieved an average
	classification accuracy of 83 percent, 92 percent, 89 percent for
	the first, second, and third level, respectively. A seperate experiment
	based on MFCC has also been performed for this tasks. By analyzing
	the results, the authors claimed that the MFCC features performed
	better for natural sounds, whereas LDB features were performed slighting
	better for artifical sounds.In addition, by combining the LDB features
	with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the average classification
	accuracies reached 91 percent for the first level, 99 percent for
	the second level, and 95 percent for the third level. Future work
	included improving the selection process of LDB leading to an optimal
	number of LDBs for a given classification problem. In addition, the
	authors expect to explore more dissimilarity measures for audio classification.
	The work in this paper is highly related with what I am doing. The
	scheme for feature extraction and selection can be adapted in my
	project. However, I should firstly investigate the LDB technique.},

	In this article, we introduce a robust, text-independent speaker

	from a psycho-acoustic model into which the subspace-based enhancement
	technique is incorporated. We use the prior SNR of each subband within
	the perceptual filterbank to decide the estimator's gain to effectively
	suppress environmental background noises. Then, probabilistic SVMs

	classification tasks, where the training data set for each task is
	not drawn from the same statistical distribution. In such a multi-task
	learning (MTL) scenario, it is necessary to identify groups of similar
	tasks that should be learned jointly. Relying on a Dirichlet process
	(DP) based statistical model to learn the extent of similarity between
	classification tasks, we develop computationally efficient algorithms
	for two different forms of the MTL problem. First, we consider a
	symmetric multi-task learning (SMTL) situation in which classifiers
	for multiple tasks are learned jointly using a variational Bayesian
	(VB) algorithm. Second, we consider an asymmetric multi-task learning
	(AMTL) formulation in which the posterior density function from the
	SMTL model parameters (from previous tasks) is used as a prior for
	a new task: this approach has the significant advantage of not requiring
	storage and use of all previous data from prior tasks. The AMTL formulation
	is solved with a simple Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) construction.
	Experimental results on two real life MTL problems indicate that
	the proposed algorithms: (a) automatically identify subgroups of
	related tasks whose training data appear to be drawn from similar
	distributions; and (b) are more accurate than simpler approaches
	such as single-task learning, pooling of data across all tasks, and
	simplified approximations to DP.},

  abstract = {Information overload is a critical problem in World Wide Web. Category
	map developed based on Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) has been
	proven to be a promising browsing tool for the Web. The SOM algorithm
	automatically categorizes a large Internet information space into
	manageable sub-spaces. It compresses and transforms a complex information
	space into a two-dimensional graphical representation. Such graphical
	representation provides a user-friendly interface for users to explore
	the automatically generated mental model. However, as the amount
	of information increases, it is expected to increase the size of
	the category map accordingly in order to accommodate the important
	concepts in the information space. It results in increasing of visual
	load of the category map. Large pool of information is packed closely
	together on a limited size of displaying window, where local details
	are difficult to be clearly seen. In this paper, we propose the fisheye
	views and fractal views to support the visualization of category
	map. Fisheye views are developed based on the distortion approach
	while fractal views are developed based on the information reduction
	approach. The purpose of fisheye views are to enlarge the regions
	of interest and diminish the regions that are further away while
	maintaining the global structure. On the other hand, fractal views
	are an approximation mechanism to abstract complex objects and control
	the amount of information to be displayed. We have developed a prototype
	system and conducted a user evaluation to investigate the performance
	of fisheye views and fractal views. The results show that both fisheye
	views and fractal views significantly increase the effectiveness
	of visualizing category map. In addition, fractal views are significantly
	better than fisheye views but the combination of fractal views and
	fisheye views do not increase the performance compared to each individual
	technique.},

	reconstructed state space is proposed for feature extraction due
	to 1) manifolds are of importance in characterizing chaotic attractorss
	and 2) there are a large number of toolkits in the context of manifold
	learning. This paper serves to bridge the gap between nonlinear science
	and manifold learning. Specifically, the proposed method works according
	to the following steps. First, the time series of interest is embedded
	into a high-dimensional space via state space reconstruction. Next,
	locally linear embedding (LLE) is employed to obtain the local manifold
	characteristics around every point in the reconstructed state space.
	Finally, all the local features are summarised into a global representation
	via principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed framework is
	applied for two cases of oceanic and EEG signal classification. As
	for the classification of oceanic siganl, the proposed method yeilds
	an accuracy of 97.93 percent, compared with that based on Lyapunov
	and spectra, 97.73 percent and 97.17 percent, respectively. For classification
	of EEG signal, the accurcay of the proposed method is 95.4 percent,
	compared with 86.33 and 95.33 percent, based on Lyapunov and spectra,
	respectively. The experimental result indicated that the proposed
	method is promising. Every sample was normalized to possess unit
	energy in the preprocessing. The main problem solved in this paper
	is that it transforms the LLE into a global feature space, by which
	the features for each sample could be put in the same space, i.e.
	with the same dimension.}

  abstract = {Different attitudes towards gains and losses are a prominent feature
	of cumulative prospect theory for decision under uncertainty. In
	particular, decision weights for uncertain events can depend on whether
	the events involve gains or losses, and the shape of the utility
	function can reveal loss aversion. Decision analyses concentrate
	on event capacities, which determine decision weights, and on the
	shape of the utility function. The present paper focuses on linear/exponential,
	power-function and multilinear utility models for decision under
	uncertainty. We begin with straightforward preference axioms for
	a representation by a cumulative prospect theory functional. The
	axioms include weak ordering, continuity, monotonicity and tail independence.
	We show that in their presence constant absolute (proportional) risk
	aversion implies linear/exponential (power) utility. Then, for the
	multiattribute case, (mutual) utility independence leads to a utility
	function that is (additive/multiplicative) multilinear.},

	should be overcome. First, the system is always limited by the restricted
	computational resources such as the CPU speed and memory size. Another
	difficulty is the unreliability of wireless communication due to
	unreliable and erroneous radio signals. Finally, maybe most importantly,
	knowledge of a target's motion is unavailable or limited due to the
	frequency changes in velocity and direction. Pervious research has
	proposed several approaches to estimate the locations of targets
	in a wireless sensor network. Generally, these approaches can be
	divided into two classes. The first class employs only the sensor
	information such as the triangulation approach and the nearest neighbor
	in signal space (NNSS). This class of methods is computationally
	efficient whereas it ignores the target's behavior leading to poor
	performance of tracking. The second class utilize both the sensory
	information and the target's motion model such as, the classic Kalman
	filter (KF) approach and the Markov localization (ML) approach. The
	authors extended the ML approach and developed a new method, namely,
	multiple-hypotheses ML (MHML). Both ML and MHML approach requires
	a probabilistic sensory model and a motion model for the moving targets,
	whereas MHML dynamically generated a set of hypothetical motion models
	and selected the most likely motion model to apply. With increasing
	knowledge of a motion model, the proposed method can utilize it to
	reduce the space of the esitmated motion models, and thus improve
	the quality of localization. In addtion, two features were demonstrated.
	First, the estimation accuracy increases if more sensor are used.
	Second, the estimation asymptotically converge to the target's real
	position. Experiment analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach
	yielded substantially more accurate and robust location estimations
	than the previous approaches using only sensory information, and
	it was competitive with the standard Markov localizaiton approach.},

	to annotate and share objects on the Web. However, with the growth
	of social tagging systems, users are easily overwhelmed by the large
	amount of data and it is very difficult for users to dig out information
	that he/she is interested in. Though the tagging system has provided
	interest-based social network features to enable the user to keep
	track of other users' tagging activities, there is still no automatic
	and effective way for the user to discover other users with common
	interests. In this paper, we propose a User Recommendation (UserRec)
	framework for user interest modeling and interest-based user recommendation,
	aiming to boost information sharing among users with similar interests.
	Our work brings three major contributions to the research community:
	(1) we propose a tag-graph based community detection method to model
	the users' personal interests, which are further represented by discrete
	topic distributions; (2) the similarity values between users' topic
	distributions are measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence),
	and the similarity values are further used to perform interest-based
	user recommendation; and (3) by analyzing users' roles in a tagging
	system, we find users' roles in a tagging system are similar to Web
	pages in the Internet. Experiments on tagging dataset of Web pages
	(Yahoo!~Delicious) show that UserRec outperforms other state-of-the-art
	recommender system approaches.},

	of the system's component and its importance is tested. The evaluation
	results indicate the importance of an audio segmentation and a speech
	detection module to the reliable performance of the whole system.
	Among the four modules, the speech detection module aims at finding
	the regions of speech in an audio system. Here, the non-speech data
	consist of many acoustic phenomena such as silence, music, background
	noise or cross-talk. The author develop four different measures based
	on consonant-vowel pairs and voice-unvoiced regions obtained from
	phoneme speech recognizers. The evaluation experiments on the BN
	audio data proved that a combination of acoustic features modeled
	by MFCCs and the proposed phoneme-recognition features constituted
	the most powerful representation of audio data. In this paper, the
	authors cast the speech detection problem as classification problem.
	The detection was performed by using a standard maximum likelihood
	classification with two GMMs (one model for speech and the other
	for non-speech). There are several disadvantages as follows: \begin{itemize}
	\item The GMMs representing non-speech phenomena cannot model all
	the non-speech acoustic phenomena. \item The performance of speech
	detection is highly dependent on the accuracy of phoneme speech recognizers.
	In this case, the speech detection module degrade when the speech
	is corrupted by noise or other types of audio event such as music
	and song. \item The speech detection module work only in the scenario
	when the audio contains only a single speaker's speech. Thus, the
	method proposed in this paper can not be extended to the our case.
