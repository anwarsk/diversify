In this paper, we presented a new derivation of diverse retrieval by directly
optimizing the expected n-call@$k$ set-based retrieval objective
w.r.t.\ a latent subtopic model of binary relevance.  This result both
motivates and contrasts with various related diversification
approaches, providing a new theoretical basis for the investigation
of diverse retrieval. Empirical results on three real-world data sets reflected our theoretical results. 

Future work includes the study of efficiently optimizing the n-call@$k$ objecive function by possibly exploiting the submodularity \cite{Borodin:Database2012}. Additional, it is also important to study the temporal diveristy as suggested in \cite{lathia10TemporalDiversity} and \cite{Zhao:SIGIR2012}.
